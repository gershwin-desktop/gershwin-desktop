## Why Gershwin?

Having a Gershwin Desktop Environment community flavor hosted by GhostBSD encourages **growth of Objective-C and Cocoa-style application development**.  Where Gershwin comes into play is theming, packaging, distribution, putting together various settings, solving technical problems, and modernizing applications.

## What does Gershwin offer?

Gershwin offers Workspace, Terminal, TextEdit, System Preferences, a native Window Manager for X11 apps, a Global Menu server for GNUstep/X11 apps, and more.  

## Installation

Gershwin can be installed in under a few minutes by using [gershwin-build](https://github.com/gershwin-desktop/gershwin-build).  For the most up to date ISO users can try a [gershwin-on-debian live iso](https://github.com/gershwin-desktop/gershwin-on-debian/releases/tag/continuous).  An older community preivew can also be found at GhostBSD where live ISOs are also available via [GhostBSD](https://www.ghostbsd.org/download) for testing and evaluation.

## FAQ

* Will Gershwin ever support Wayland?  GNUstep has experimental Wayland support and we use it's core libs.   
* Will Gershwin ever be Wayland only?  There will be no effort to make Gershwin Wayland only since we use core libs from GNUstep.
* What window manager is Gershwin using?  XFCE4-WM, but this may be replaced by soon by uroswm, a native window manager based on xcbkit that is being fixed up to be integrated with Gershwin.  
* Will the Gershwin team ever consider providing an option for non Macintosh UX style?  Yes, a Windows-style layout option might be something we develop in the future in collaboration with GhostBSD.
